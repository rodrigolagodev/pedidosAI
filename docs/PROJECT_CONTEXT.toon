project:
  name: Pedidos
  summary: Web app that automates order management and delivery to suppliers in restaurants via voice/text input and AI classification.
  language: Spanish (Latin America)
  users: Kitchen chefs and purchase managers in gastronomic businesses
problem:
  core: "Chef must manually transcribe handwritten notes to individual WhatsApp/email messages for each supplier at end of tiring service day."
  painPoints[4]: Manual transcription inefficiency,Multiple fragmented conversations,No centralized history,Adverse conditions (cold room with hands occupied)
solution:
  flow[6]: Voice/Text,Transcription,AI Parsing,Classification by supplier,Human review,Delivery
  features:
    input[3]: voice (audio transcription),text (direct typing),mixed (both in same session)
    classification:
      method: "AI matches items to suppliers using category vocabulary + custom keywords"
      synonymHandling: "Learns regional variations (potato/papa, courgette/zucchini)"
      fallback: Unclassified items shown for manual assignment
    review:
      required: true
      actions[4]: Edit quantities,Move items between suppliers,Delete items,Assign unclassified
